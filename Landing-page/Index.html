          <h1>DESIGN HISTORY</h1>
          <p>
            The Kyocera Finecam S3 introduced a radically simplified design with
            only essential controls, challenging the button-heavy cameras of the
            era. Its compact form factor set new standards for portability.
            Canon's Digital ELPH series perfected the balance between
            functionality and minimalism. With sleek metal bodies and intuitive
            interfaces, these cameras made high-quality photography accessible
            to everyone.
            Minimal camera design follows the principle that "less is more." By
            stripping away unnecessary features and controls, these cameras
            allow photographers to focus on what truly matters: composition,
            light, and moment.

          </div>
          <p>This philosophy has evolved from physical simplification to
            intelligent automation, where advanced technology works silently in
            the background to deliver exceptional results with minimal user
            intervention.</p>

              <h1>It always seems impossible before anyone do it</h1>
              <p>In an industry obsessed with more features, creating a minimal
                camera seemed impossible. Critics claimed photographers needed
                endless options. We believed otherwise.
                We stripped away everything non-essential, eliminating the
                paralysis of choice. The result is pure photography—no
                complicated
                settings, just the fundamental connection between photographer
                and
                moment.</p>

          <h1>The Power of Simplicity</h1>
          <p>MinimaCam harnesses the profound power of simplicity. By
            eliminating feature overload and decision fatigue, we return
            photography to its essence: seeing.
            With fewer distractions, you focus on composition, light, and
            moment—the true heart of photography. Our minimalist design creates
            clarity where complexity once caused hesitation.Simplicity isn't
            about having less—it's about having exactly what you need. MinimaCam
            proves that true power lies in purposeful reduction, where every
            subtraction adds meaning.</p>
